<h1> web Adress </h1>

	<strong> <mark> https://www.simons-rock.edu </mark> </strong> <em>is a fully qualified URL that takes you to the main page of a web site.</em> <br>

<strong>github.com</strong> is not a fully qualified URL. It's something you can type into your browser, but you can't use it in HTML â€¦ unless what you meant was "a file called github.com in the same directory as this HTML file", which you probably didn't. <br>

<strong>http:///Users/karl/index.html</strong> is a mess! It's an http URL, but it doesn't have a domain name on it. The browser won't know what to do with this since it's http, but there's no server to connect to!<br>

And <strong>file:///home/kelly/photos/Scotland1.jpg</strong> is a perfectly fine file URL for referring to a file on your own computer ... if you happen to be Kelly on a Linux computer. But keep in mind, if you give a file:// URL to someone else, they probably can't access it because they don't have that file in the exact same location.<br>
